WebGoatPHP
==========
OWASP WebGoatPHP is a port of OWASP WebGoat to PHP and MySQL/SQLite databases. The goal is to create an interactive teaching environment for web application security by offering lessons in the form of challenges. In each challenge the user must exploit the vulnerability to demonstrate their understanding.

WebGoatPHP supports four different modes i.e single mode, workshop mode, contest mode and secure coding mode.
